## 1 Introduction


iScream is the implmentation of a rewards system where designated VIP customers can accrue points and earn rewards for continued patronage of a local Atlanta ice cream cart, IScream.  It offers the ability to manage the reward system from a mobile device.  

## 2 Business Needs/Requirements

Brad and Janet, the owners of the local Atlanta ice cream cart IScream, want to put in place a reward system based on VIP cards on which customers can accrue points based on the amount of money they spend and get benefits based on their points.  In a heavily saturated market of fast food desserts, brick-and-mortar coffee shops and dessert boutiques, Brad and Janet believe that along with leveraging the mobility of their business, attracting and maintaining repeat customers, particularly targeted "VIP" customers, is a key to their future success.   

## 3 Product / Solution Overview

Our team's solution is heavily influenced by the clients' desire to be able to manage the reward system on mobile devices. Based on these requirements, our team has chosen to develop the rewards management software system for Android.  The built in functions of the Android platform and the readily available development tools will allow for  a rapid development and deployment timeline to meet the clients' schedule.
