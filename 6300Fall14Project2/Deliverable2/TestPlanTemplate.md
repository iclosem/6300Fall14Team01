# Test Plan

*This is the template for your test plan. The parts in italics are concise explanations of what should go in the corresponding sections and should not appear in the final document.*

## 2 Testing Strategy

### 2.1 Overall strategy

*This section should provide details about your unit-, integration-, system-, and regression-testing strategies. In particular, it should discuss which activities you will perform as part of your testing process, and who will perform such activities.*

### 2.2 Test Selection

*Here you should discuss how you are going to select your test cases, that is, which black-box and/or white-box techniques you will use. If you plan to use different techniques at different testing levels (e.g., unit and system), you should clarify that.*

### 2.3 Adequacy Criterion

*Define how you are going to assess the quality of your test cases. Typically, this involves some form of functional or structural coverage. If you plan to use different techniques at different testing levels (e.g., unit and system), you should clarify that.*

### 2.4 Bug Tracking

*Describe how bugs and enhancement requests will be tracked.*

### 2.5 Technology

*Describe any testing technology you intend to use or build (e.g., JUnit, Selenium).*

## 4 Test Cases

*This section should be the core of this document. You should provide a table of test cases, one per row. For each test case, the table should provide its purpose, the steps necessary to perform the test, the expected result, the actual result (to be filled later), pass/fail information (to be filled later), and any additional information you think is relevant.*
