## Introduction

#### Scope and Purpose

iScream is a mobile device application designed to manage sales and customer data for an ice cream cart business.  It allows the creation and maintenance of a database of "VIP" customers and tracks rewards these customers earn based on their continued patronage. 

This User manual outlines the basic operation of iScream including instructions for all of the application features and how each feature is intended to be used during normal business operation. Minimal previous mobile device experience is required for the user, and it is assumed that the user is fully trained on the operation of the ice cream cart business and its reward system for VIP customers.  

The mobile device utilized must run the Android operating system version 4.4.2 (API 19 Kit Kat).


#### Process Overview

iScream manages 5 basic user input scenarios represented by tabs on the application's main screen. 

1.	Process a Purchase - the SELL tab
2.	Process a Preorder - the PREORDER tab
3.	Review, Edit, delete VIP customer data - the VIPS tab
4.	Pull a daily Sales report - the REPORTS tab
5.	Create VIP customer - the CREATE tab.
