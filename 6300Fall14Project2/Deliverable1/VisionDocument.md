# Vision Document

*This is the template for your vision document, adapted from a [template provided by StartupCTO](http://www.startupcto.com/templates/software-vision-document-template). You can refer to their document for additional details and examples.) Your final document should be a couple of pages long. The parts in italics are concise explanations of what should go in the corresponding sections and should not appear in the final document.*

## 1 Introduction

*Here you introduce the product. Keep this  clean 	and simple, one or two sentences at most.*

IceCreamCart is the implmentation of a rewards system with which customers can accrue points and earn rewards for continued patronage of a local Atlanta ice cream cart, IScream.  It offers the ability to manage the reward system from a mobile device.  

## 2 Business Needs/Requirements

*Here you discuss the reason you are planning to build your product. You’ll want to talk about the problem people are facing, the requirements you need to meet to solve that problem (10000-foot view), and the market itself. Essentially, you’re making a case that the product needs to be built.*

Brad and Janet, the owners of the local Atlanta ice cream cart IScream, want to put in place a reward system based on VIP cards on which customers can accrue points based on the amount of money they spend and get benefits based on their
points. 

## 3 Product / Solution Overview

*Here you talk about the product itself. Give a high level overview of the solution and how it meets the needs outlined above. Optionally, you can talk about plans for both this version and future versions.*

Our team's solution was heavily influenced by Brad and Janet's desire to be able to manage their reward system on their mobile devices. Our team has chosen to develop the rewards management software system for Android. 

## 4 Major Features (Optional)

*Here you outline the features at a high level (a detailed feature outline belongs in the requirements document.) Some people prefer to outline features in the above Product/Solution Overview section, which is also a fine approach. Whatever you do, keep it to bullet points, not paragraphs. If you can use pictures, such as mockups, even better.*
  - Ability to preorder ice cream
  - Rewards through discounts and free product
  - Ability to generate reports detailing recent purchase history
  - Customer tracking
  

## 5 Scope and Limitations

*The Scope and Limitations section is where you talk about what is, and in particular, what is not included. This is where you tactfully tell your boss that his pet feature is not going to be included.*
