## 1 Introduction


IceCreamCart is the implmentation of a rewards system where designated VIP customers can accrue points and earn rewards for continued patronage of a local Atlanta ice cream cart, IScream.  It offers the ability to manage the reward system from a mobile device.  

## 2 Business Needs/Requirements

*Here you discuss the reason you are planning to build your product. You’ll want to talk about the problem people are facing, the requirements you need to meet to solve that problem (10000-foot view), and the market itself. Essentially, you’re making a case that the product needs to be built.*

Brad and Janet, the owners of the local Atlanta ice cream cart IScream, want to put in place a reward system based on VIP cards on which customers can accrue points based on the amount of money they spend and get benefits based on their points.  In a heavily saturated market of fast food desserts, brick-and-mortar coffee shops and dessert boutiques, Brad and Janet believe that along with leveraging the mobility of their business, attracting and maintaining repeat customers, particularly targeted "VIP" customers, is a key to their future success.   

## 3 Product / Solution Overview

*Here you talk about the product itself. Give a high level overview of the solution and how it meets the needs outlined above. Optionally, you can talk about plans for both this version and future versions.*

Our team's solution is heavily influenced by the clients' desire to be able to manage the reward system on mobile devices. Based on these requirements, our team has chosen to develop the rewards management software system for Android.  The built in functions of the Android platform and the readily available development tools will allow for  a rapid development and deployment time line to meet the clients' schedule.
