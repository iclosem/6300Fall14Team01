requirements specified by the client.  

### 2) Process Description

Process description as a set of activities; for each activity, provide the following:

#### Software Concept

- **Activity description**  The software concept phase of development is where the initial idea for the

that will help define the basis for the requirements completed formally in the next phase.  During this phase
our team will also define roles and responsibilities and assign roles for each team member  to assume.
	  
- **Entrance criteria**  The entrance criterea for this phase of the process 
- **Exit criteria** (outputs produced by the activity and how you know it has been completed satisfactorily)

### 4) Estimates

Provide estimates for the following metrics:

- Effort hours: total number of team-member hours you expect to spend on the project
- Lines of code: 
  - Main Class: 200 lines of code *I estimated this based on my simple implemenation that needs a few more edge cases handled, it was around 70 lines of code, but could grow due to architecture decisions*
  - Tests: 300 lines of code
