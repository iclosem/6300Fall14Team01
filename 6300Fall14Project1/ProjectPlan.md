### 1) Introduction

The purpose of the Average Sentence Length project is to analyze the requirements, design, and implement the
defined software tool. The Average Sentence Length Tool will provide students a way to check the average number of words per sentence in their essays, according to the requirements specified by the client.  

### 2) Process Descriptions

#### Software Concept

- **Activity description**  The software concept phase of development is where the initial idea for the 
product is provided to the development team by the customer. During this phase, broad conceptual questions are asked
that will help define the basis for the requirements completed formally in the next phase. The development team will also define roles and responsibilities and assign roles for each team member to assume.
- **Entrance criteria**  The customer needs to have a conceptual idea of basic uses of the requested deliverable 
in order to start this part of the process.
- **Exit criteria**   Basic requirements should be documented and preliminary roles defined prior to starting the next phase of the process. 

#### Requirements Analysis 

- **Activity description** During this phase of development, requirements will be formalized and more definite behavior
expected by the application will be specified.  
- **Entrance criteria** Completion of a basic idea of required functionality
- **Exit criteria** A set of defined requirements that can be easily linked to specific functionality within the product.  
Ideally these requirements will be codified with expected outputs. 

#### Architectural Design

- **Activity description** During the architectural design phase, user interface, input types, output types and basic user 
experience should all be considered when planning for the architecture. The architecture should complement the requirements 
defined in the previous process. Implementation language, target platforms, and domain restrictions should be explored and 
defined during this point in the process.
- **Entrance criteria** A well-specified product defined by the requirements collected in the requirements analysis phase.  
An extensive set of stakeholder behaviors and use cases should also be defined by this time. 
- **Exit criteria**  A clear idea of the user interface, language, target platform and broad component interactions.

#### Detailed Design

- **Activity description** This phase should focus on designing the objects interactions with each other and defining the data attributes, 
functions, and class relationships. These interactions should be structured in a way that is easily testable and verifiable.
- **Entrance criteria** An understanding of the data inputs and expected outputs 
- **Exit criteria** A formal specification of the relationships of the classes. Skeleton code can be generated to show the structure of 
the program, source hierarchy, etc. 
 
#### Coding and debugging

- **Activity description** This phase focuses on the implementation of the detailed design. This is where all design decisions are implemented
and integration tests and unit tests are created to ensure those design decisions are adhered to. 
- **Entrance criteria** A complete specification of the system design and assignments for each team member for implementation and debugging of 
certain sections of functionality. 
- **Exit criteria** A test that meets basic verification tests showing that the program is functioning correctly under ideal conditions.

#### System Testing

- **Activity description** During this section, tests that were written in the coding and debugging phase should be scrutinized to 
ensure they cover all areas contained in the implementation and any edge cases.
- **Entrance criteria** A functionally complete implementation of the product and a set of well defined tests that verify basic IO.
- **Exit criteria** To exit this, near 100% code coverage and a full compliment of tests that test the durability of the application.  

### 3) Team

#### Roles :
- **Project Manager**:  The project manager is responsible for the agenda, note taking, upkeep of project management software, 
assigning tasks and submission of design documents and delivery of final product to the customer.
- **Development Lead**:  The development lead makes initial design decisions based on customer requirements that will allow 
for easy division amongst the rest of the team as functionality is added to the program.  The development lead should also
work closely with the QA manager to ensure all functionality is understood and easily testable.
- **QA Manager**: The quality assurance manager is responsible for ensuring that the product is well tested, interfaces are
well defined and easy to use, and that customer requirements have been met.
- **Documentation Lead**: The Documentation lead ensures that design documents are consistent throughout and that the implementation
is well documented and is responsible for the user manual and help feature implementation.  
- **Developer (Individual Contributor)**:  The developer will adhere to the design vision provided by the development lead   
- **QA Individual Contributor**: QA contributors will implement the testing strategy set by the QA manager.  
- **Pull Request Reviewer**:  These users are responsible for the merging and integration of disparate development branches.
