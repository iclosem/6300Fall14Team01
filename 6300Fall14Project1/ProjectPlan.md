### 1) Introduction

The purpose of the Average Sentance Length project is to analyze the requirements of, design, implement and maintain the
software defining a tool that will provide students a way to check the average sentance length of their essays, according to the
requirements specified by the client.  

### 2) Process Descriptions

#### Software Concept

- **Activity description**  The software concept phase of development is where the initial idea for the 
product was provided to our team by the customer.  During this phase, broad conceptual questions are asked
that will help define the basis for the requirements completed formally in the next phase.  During this phase
our team will also define roles and responsibilities and assign roles for each team member  to assume.
- **Entrance criteria**  The customer needs to have a conceptual idea of basic uses of the requested deliverable 
in order to start this part of the process.
- **Exit criteria**   Basic requirements should be documented and preliminary roles defined prior to starting the next
phase of the process.

#### Requirements Analsys 

- **Activity description** During this phase of development, requirements will be formalized and more definate behavior
expected by the application will be specified.  
- **Entrance criteria** Completion of a basic idea of required functionality
- **Exit criteria** A set of defined requirements that can be easily linked to specific functionality within the product.  
Ideally these requirements will be codified with expected outputs and use cases.  

#### Architectual Design

- **Activity description** During the architectual design phase, basic implementation layout should be specified.  User interface,
input types, output types and basic user experiance should all be considered when planning for the architecture.  The achitecture 
should complement the requirements defined in the previous process. 
- **Entrance criteria** A well specified product defined by the requirements collected in the requirements analsys phase.  
Implementation language, target platforms, and domain restrictions should be defined at this point as well as an extensive set of
stakeholder behaviors. 
- **Exit criteria**  To exit this phase, a basic class hierarchy should be developed, showing how all pieces will work together to acheive 
desired outcome.

#### Detailed Design

- **Activity description** This phase should focus on designing the
OO Analysis, UML
- **Entrance criteria**(inputs needed for the activity)
- **Exit criteria** (outputs produced by the activity and how you know it has been completed satisfactorily)
 
#### Coding and debugging

- **Activity description** (concise paragraph)
- **Entrance criteria**(inputs needed for the activity)
- **Exit criteria** (outputs produced by the activity and how you know it has been completed satisfactorily)

#### System Testing

- **Activity description** (concise paragraph)
- **Entrance criteria**(inputs needed for the activity)
- **Exit criteria** (outputs produced by the activity and how you know it has been completed satisfactorily)

#### Maintenance
*i am not sure if we need this one, was not in the videos*
- **Activity description** (concise paragraph)
- **Entrance criteria**(inputs needed for the activity)
- **Exit criteria** (outputs produced by the activity and how you know it has been completed satisfactorily)

### 3) Team

Describe the team and their roles (there may be more roles than there are team members)

#### Team Members:

| Name  				| GATECH Username		| E-mail						| Alias |
| --------------------- |:---------------------:|:-----------------------------:|:-----:| 
| [Alex Bowers Schoen](http://github.com/bowersaa )  	| abowers9				| alexandra.bowers@gmail.com 	| [ABS](http://github.com/bowersaa )   |
| [Alex Hortin](http://github.com/hortinstein) 	 		| ahortin3				| hortinstein@gmail.com  		| [AH](http://github.com/hortinstein )    |

#### Roles :
- **Project Manager**:  The project manager is responsible for the agenda, note taking, upkeep of project management software, 
assigning taskes and submission of design documents and delivery of final product to the customer.
- **Development Lead**:  The development lead makes initial design decisions based on customer requirements that will allow 
for easy division amongst the rest of the team as functionality is added to the program.  The development lead should also
work closely with the QA manager to ensure all functionality is understood and easily testable.
- **QA Manager**: The quality assurance manager is responsible for ensuring that the product is well tested, interfaces are
well defined and easy to use, and that customer requirements have been met.
- **Documentation Lead**: The Documentation lead ensures that design documents are consistent throughout and that the implementation
is well documented and adheres to a consistent conding style.
- **Developer (Individual Contributor)**:  The developer will adhere to the design vision provided by the development lead   
- **QA Individual Contributor**: QA contributers will implement the testing strategy set by the QA manager.  
- **Pull Request Reviewer**:  These users are responsible for the merging and integration of disparate development branches.

### 4) Estimates

Provide estimates for the following metrics:
#### Effort Hours
- Effort hours: 40 *rough estimate based on 5 hours per each part per person, maybe a little bit on the high side, but documentation 
takes alot of time*

#### Lines of Code
  - Main Class: **200 lines of code** *I estimated this based on my simple implemenation that needs a few more edge cases handled, it was around 70 lines of code, but could grow due to architecture decisions*
  - Tests: **300 lines of code**
