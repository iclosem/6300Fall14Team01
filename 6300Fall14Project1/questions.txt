This is the file for questions.

Alex H's rough Questions (none) are critical, just food for thought for the group:
1) Is there default behavior needed (ie set of default sentance deliminators) for 
   sentances or should we just throw an error if -d and proper subsequent string is not present
2) Would your students be interested in a printed list of largest to smallest 
   sentances to easily identify where their problem areas are?   
3) Should spaces be counted, or can we just average word length
   If so, Should we expect any lists or strange formats that would require special white space handling?
4) Are there any perfonance considerations we need to take into consideration?  
   Assuming a run time of less then 5 Seconds is acceptible.
5) Should elipses be treated different then periods?
6) How Should quotations within sentances be handled?
