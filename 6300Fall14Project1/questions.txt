This is the file for questions.

Alex H's rough Questions (none) are critical, just food for thought for the group:
1) Would your students be interested in a printed list of largest to smallest 
   sentences to easily identify where their problem areas are?   
2) Should spaces be counted, or can we just average word length?
   If so, should we expect any lists or strange formats that would require special white space handling?
3) Are there any performance considerations we need to take into consideration?  
   Assuming a run time of less then 5 Seconds is acceptible.


Alex BSâ€™s questions:
1) Should we limit what they can specify as a delimiter? Can they specify letters/numbers as sentence delimiters?
