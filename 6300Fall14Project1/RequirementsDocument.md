####User Requirements

#####Software Interfaces

- **Command Line**, Windows, Linux, Mac
- **File System** : retrieves student essay
- **Java Compiler**
- **Make** (Makefiles for automating building and testing)
- **Java Libraries**: All java libraries are contained within the Standard Library:
```java
//this is the library that is built for filehandling,
//to read the file in as a string use readAllBytes
import java.nio.file.Files; 
//this will help open the file: Paths.get(filename)
import java.nio.file.Paths;
//for testing
import org.junit.Test;
``` 
 
#####User Interfaces

- Command line input
	- Required input: a text input file
	- Optional input: sentence delimiters, minimum word length
- Documentation view or help interface
- Output view 

######User Characteristics

- College students with at least some experience with computer file systems
- Mixed computer proficiency from beginner to advanced
- Experience varies across multiple platforms

####System Requirements

These subsections contain all the software requirements at a level of detail sufficient to enable designers/developers to design/develop a system that satisfies the clientâ€™s requirements, and enough detail to allow testers to test that the system satisfies those requirements. This part of the document provides a numbered list of simple, complete, and consistent functional and non-functional requirements.
