## 6300Fall14Team01 - Project 1 

Team members, I do not know what any of you have used in the past for project collaboration, but I have heard good 
things about basecamp.  Trello is also an option.  I really quickly put together some basic documents and invited
you all to a basecamp instance with a few todo lists populated, if you have any thoughts on what we should use...
